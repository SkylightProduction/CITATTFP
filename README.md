# Custom item to activate the Twilight Forest portal
### To make the portal to the Twilight Forest open with an item other than a diamond, follow the instructions:
- [Download the archive.](https://github.com/SkylightProduction/Custom-item-to-activate-the-Twilight-Forest-portal/releases/tag/CITATTFP)
- Open the archive.
- Go to: data/twilightforest/tags/items/portal.
- Open activator.json file.

Now you need to get the details of the item you want to replace the diamond with.
You can do this by typing the combination F3+H on your keyboard (with Minecraft on), and hovering over the desired item in your inventory.

- Enter this data in a JSON file instead of divinerpg:hellstone_ingot (!leave the quotes!).
- Save the document and close it along with the archive.
- Move datapack to your world in the path: C:\Users\(UserName)\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft\saves\(WorldName)\datapacks.
- You're done.

I recommend using [OpenLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader) or [Paxi](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paxi) to use in modpacks if there are datapacks.
